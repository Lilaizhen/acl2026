\section*{Abstract}
Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools have become increasingly prevalent in AI systems, enabling seamless integration between language models and external services. However, the security vulnerabilities of these tools remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present Semantic MCP Tool Hijacking (SMTH), a novel genetic algorithm-based approach for generating semantic attacks on MCP tools. Our methodology systematically evolves adversarial prompts that exploit semantic weaknesses in tool descriptions and parameter validation mechanisms. We evaluate our approach on a comprehensive benchmark of over 100 MCP tools, demonstrating that genetic algorithm-based attacks achieve a 73.2\% success rate in bypassing security measures, significantly outperforming baseline random attacks (23.1\%). Our analysis reveals specific vulnerability patterns in semantic parsing and suggests practical countermeasures for improving MCP tool security. This research contributes to the emerging field of AI tool security and provides a foundation for developing more robust MCP implementations.
