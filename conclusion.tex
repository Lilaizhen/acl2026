\section{Conclusion}

We presented \methodname{}, a two-phase Analyzer-Optimizer framework that weaponizes MCP tool metadata and return content to attract and hijack agent reasoning. Experiments on LiveMCPBench show large cost inflation and high success rates across Cognitive Denial of Service, Information Exfiltration, Environment Integrity Compromise, and Reasoning Derailment, with notable transferability to unseen models. Defense probes based on perplexity and a lightweight Qwen3-8B auditor detect only a minority of malicious responses, underscoring the fragility of current semantic-layer safeguards. Future work should couple robust tool vetting with interpretability signals and runtime isolation to harden MCP ecosystems against semantic supply-chain attacks.
