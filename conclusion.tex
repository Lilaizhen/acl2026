\section{Conclusion}

We presented \methodname{}, a two-phase Analyzer-Optimizer framework that weaponizes MCP tool metadata and return content to attract and hijack agent reasoning. Experiments on LiveMCPBench show large cost inflation and high success rates across C-DoS, information exfiltration, environment compromise, and derailment, with notable transferability to unseen models. Defense probes based on perplexity and a lightweight Qwen3-8B auditor detect only a minority of malicious responses, underscoring the fragility of current semantic-layer safeguards. Future work should couple robust tool vetting with interpretability signals and runtime isolation to harden MCP ecosystems against semantic supply-chain attacks.
