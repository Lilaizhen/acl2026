\section{Conclusion}
This work introduces \textbf{Semantic MCP Tool Hijacking (SMTH)}, a unified framework for studying semantic-layer vulnerabilities in MCP-powered agents. 
Through controlled experiments on \textbf{LiveMCPBench}, we show that adversarially crafted tool definitions can significantly increase internal reasoning cost, trigger targeted behaviors such as backdoor execution and task failure, and transfer across different model families. 
The results demonstrate that the semantic interpretation of tool metadata, rather than model parameters alone, plays a decisive role in agent security. 
We hope SMTH can serve as a foundation for developing semantic-level defense benchmarks and for guiding the design of safer agentâ€“tool interaction protocols.
